Fabric is a Move Runtime for web2 or centralized services.

#### What Could This Bring About?

- Financial apps could leverage the security of the Move language.
- Web2 wallet systems can be implemented in Move without the need for a blockchain.

- Web2 authentication flow (provided by the integrator) â€” no cryptography-based authentication required.
